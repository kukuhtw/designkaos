AI T-Shirt Design Application – Documentation (EN)
________________________________________
🌟 Introduction
This is a t-shirt design application that allows you to generate a realistic visual of a person wearing your custom t-shirt design using AI. 
It simplifies the process of visualizing and presenting your digital t-shirt artwork.
As a side hustle, you can become a freelance t-shirt designer. 
Just find a local DTG (Direct to Garment) t-shirt printing vendor near you. 
Compare prices, shirt colors, materials, and sizes. For each customer order, 
you can set your own profit margin between 10% to 30%.

You can upload:
•	Your t-shirt design (artwork)
•	A person’s photo (endorser or model wearing a plain t-shirt)
The AI will merge your digital design with the model photo, resulting in a mock-up of a t-shirt worn by that person.
Ensure your master design file is in high resolution (hi-res) to maintain quality for print or display.
